The number of values in the list depends on the _ComparisonOperator_ being used.\nFor type Number, value comparisons are numeric.\nString value comparisons for greater than, equals, or less than are based on\nASCII character code values. For example, `a` is greater than `A`, and `a` is\ngreater than `B`. For a list of code values, see\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters>.\nFor type Binary, DynamoDB treats each byte of the binary data as unsigned when\nit compares binary values.\n  * _ComparisonOperator_ \\- A comparator for evaluating attributes in the _AttributeValueList_. When performing the comparison, DynamoDB uses strongly consistent reads.\nThe following comparison operators are available:\n`EQ | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | NOT_NULL | NULL | CONTAINS | NOT_CONTAINS |\nBEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN`\nThe following are descriptions of each comparison operator.\n    * `EQ` : Equal. `EQ` is supported for all datatypes, including lists and maps.\n_AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ element of type\nString, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set.

If\nthe data type of attribute \"`a`\" is null, and you evaluate it using\n`NOT_NULL`, the result is a Boolean _true_. This result is because the\nattribute \"`a`\" exists; its data type is not relevant to the `NOT_NULL`\ncomparison operator.\n    * `NULL` : The attribute does not exist. `NULL` is supported for all datatypes, including lists and maps.\nThis operator tests for the nonexistence of an attribute, not its data type.\nIf the data type of attribute \"`a`\" is null, and you evaluate it using `NULL`,\nthe result is a Boolean _false_.

If the target attribute of the\ncomparison is of type String, then the operator checks for a substring match.\nIf the target attribute of the comparison is of type Binary, then the operator\nlooks for a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target\nattribute of the comparison is a set (\"`SS`\", \"`NS`\", or \"`BS`\"), then the\noperator evaluates to true if it finds an exact match with any member of the\nset.\nCONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating \"`a CONTAINS b`\", \"`a`\" can\nbe a list; however, \"`b`\" cannot be a set, a map, or a list.\n    * `NOT_CONTAINS` : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or absence of a value in a set.\n_AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ element of type\nString, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target attribute of the\ncomparison is a String, then the operator checks for the absence of a\nsubstring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is Binary, then the\noperator checks for the absence of a subsequence of the target that matches\nthe input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set (\"`SS`\", \"`NS`\",\nor \"`BS`\"), then the operator evaluates to true if it _does not_ find an exact\nmatch with any member of the set.\nNOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating \"`a NOT CONTAINS b`\",\n\"`a`\" can be a list; however, \"`b`\" cannot be a set, a map, or a list.\n    * `BEGINS_WITH` : Checks for a prefix. \n_AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ of type String or\nBinary (not a Number or a set type). The target attribute of the comparison\nmust be of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type).\n    * `IN` : Checks for matching elements within two sets.\n_AttributeValueList_ can contain one or more _AttributeValue_ elements of type\nString, Number, or Binary (not a set type). These attributes are compared\nagainst an existing set type attribute of an item. If any elements of the\ninput set are present in the item attribute, the expression evaluates to true.\n    * `BETWEEN` : Greater than or equal to the first value, and less than or equal to the second value. \n_AttributeValueList_ must contain two _AttributeValue_ elements of the same\ntype, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). A target attribute\nmatches if the target value is greater than, or equal to, the first element\nand less than, or equal to, the second element. If an item contains an\n_AttributeValue_ element of a different type than the one provided in the\nrequest, the value does not match. For example, `{\"S\":\"6\"}` does not compare\nto `{\"N\":\"6\"}`. Also, `{\"N\":\"6\"}` does not compare to `{\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]}`\nFor usage examples of _AttributeValueList_ and _ComparisonOperator_, see\n[Legacy Conditional Parameters](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/late\nst/developerguide/LegacyConditionalParameters.html) in the _Amazon DynamoDB\nDeveloper Guide_.\nFor backward compatibility with previous DynamoDB releases, the following\nparameters can be used instead of _AttributeValueList_ and\n_ComparisonOperator_:\n  * _Value_ \\- A value for DynamoDB to compare with an attribute.\n  * _Exists_ \\- A Boolean value that causes DynamoDB to evaluate the value before attempting the conditional operation:\n    * If _Exists_ is `true`, DynamoDB will check to see if that attribute value already exists in the table. If it is found, then the condition evaluates to true; otherwise the condition evaluate to false.\n    * If _Exists_ is `false`, DynamoDB assumes that the attribute value does _not_ exist in the table. If in fact the value does not exist, then the assumption is valid and the condition evaluates to true.

If _Value_ is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing attribute.\nIf you use `ADD` to increment or decrement a number value for an item that\ndoesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses 0 as the initial value.\nIn addition, if you use `ADD` to update an existing item, and intend to\nincrement or decrement an attribute value which does not yet exist, DynamoDB\nuses `0` as the initial value. For example, suppose that the item you want to\nupdate does not yet have an attribute named _itemcount_, but you decide to\n`ADD` the number `3` to this attribute anyway, even though it currently does\nnot exist. DynamoDB will create the _itemcount_ attribute, set its initial\nvalue to `0`, and finally add `3` to it.

If an item contains an _AttributeValue_\nelement of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value\ndoes not match. For example, `{\"S\":\"6\"}` does not equal `{\"N\":\"6\"}`. Also,\n`{\"N\":\"6\"}` does not compare to `{\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]}`.\n    * `GE` : Greater than or equal. \n_AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ element of type\nString, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an\n_AttributeValue_ element of a different type than the one provided in the\nrequest, the value does not match. For example, `{\"S\":\"6\"}` does not equal\n`{\"N\":\"6\"}`. Also, `{\"N\":\"6\"}` does not compare to `{\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]}`.\n    * `GT` : Greater than. \n_AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ element of type\nString, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an\n_AttributeValue_ element of a different type than the one provided in the\nrequest, the value does not match. For example, `{\"S\":\"6\"}` does not equal\n`{\"N\":\"6\"}`. Also, `{\"N\":\"6\"}` does not compare to `{\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]}`.\n    * `NOT_NULL` : The attribute exists. `NOT_NULL` is supported for all datatypes, including lists and maps.\nThis operator tests for the existence of an attribute, not its data type. If\nthe data type of attribute \"`a`\" is null, and you evaluate it using\n`NOT_NULL`, the result is a Boolean _true_. This result is because the\nattribute \"`a`\" exists; its data type is not relevant to the `NOT_NULL`\ncomparison operator.\n    * `NULL` : The attribute does not exist. `NULL` is supported for all datatypes, including lists and maps.\nThis operator tests for the nonexistence of an attribute, not its data type.\nIf the data type of attribute \"`a`\" is null, and you evaluate it using `NULL`,\nthe result is a Boolean _false_. This is because the attribute \"`a`\" exists;\nits data type is not relevant to the `NULL` comparison operator.\n    * `CONTAINS` : Checks for a subsequence, or value in a set.\n_AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ element of type\nString, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target attribute of the\ncomparison is of type String, then the operator checks for a substring match.\nIf the target attribute of the comparison is of type Binary, then the operator\nlooks for a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target\nattribute of the comparison is a set (\"`SS`\", \"`NS`\", or \"`BS`\"), then the\noperator evaluates to true if it finds an exact match with any member of the\nset.\nCONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating \"`a CONTAINS b`\", \"`a`\" can\nbe a list; however, \"`b`\" cannot be a set, a map, or a list.\n    * `NOT_CONTAINS` : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or absence of a value in a set.\n_AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ element of type\nString, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target attribute of the\ncomparison is a String, then the operator checks for the absence of a\nsubstring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is Binary, then the\noperator checks for the absence of a subsequence of the target that matches\nthe input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set (\"`SS`\", \"`NS`\",\nor \"`BS`\"), then the operator evaluates to true if it _does not_ find an exact\nmatch with any member of the set.\nNOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating \"`a NOT CONTAINS b`\",\n\"`a`\" can be a list; however, \"`b`\" cannot be a set, a map, or a list.\n    * `BEGINS_WITH` : Checks for a prefix. \n_AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ of type String or\nBinary (not a Number or a set type). The target attribute of the comparison\nmust be of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type).\n    * `IN` : Checks for matching elements within two sets.\n_AttributeValueList_ can contain one or more _AttributeValue_ elements of type\nString, Number, or Binary (not a set type). These attributes are compared\nagainst an existing set type attribute of an item. If any elements of the\ninput set are present in the item attribute, the expression evaluates to true.\n    * `BETWEEN` : Greater than or equal to the first value, and less than or equal to the second value. \n_AttributeValueList_ must contain two _AttributeValue_ elements of the same\ntype, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). A target attribute\nmatches if the target value is greater than, or equal to, the first element\nand less than, or equal to, the second element. If an item contains an\n_AttributeValue_ element of a different type than the one provided in the\nrequest, the value does not match. For example, `{\"S\":\"6\"}` does not compare\nto `{\"N\":\"6\"}`. Also, `{\"N\":\"6\"}` does not compare to `{\"NS\":[\"6\", \"2\", \"1\"]}`\nFor usage examples of _AttributeValueList_ and _ComparisonOperator_, see\n[Legacy Conditional Parameters](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/late\nst/developerguide/LegacyConditionalParameters.html) in the _Amazon DynamoDB\nDeveloper Guide_.\nFor backward compatibility with previous DynamoDB releases, the following\nparameters can be used instead of _AttributeValueList_ and\n_ComparisonOperator_:\n  * _Value_ \\- A value for DynamoDB to compare with an attribute.\n  * _Exists_ \\- A Boolean value that causes DynamoDB to evaluate the value before attempting the conditional operation:\n    * If _Exists_ is `true`, DynamoDB will check to see if that attribute value already exists in the table. If it is found, then the condition evaluates to true; otherwise the condition evaluate to false.\n    * If _Exists_ is `false`, DynamoDB assumes that the attribute value does _not_ exist in the table. If in fact the value does not exist, then the assumption is valid and the condition evaluates to true. If the value is found, despite the assumption that it does not exist, the condition evaluates to false.\nNote that the default value for _Exists_ is `true`.\nThe _Value_ and _Exists_ parameters are incompatible with _AttributeValueList_\nand _ComparisonOperator_.

In order to improve performance with these large-scale\noperations, _BatchWriteItem_ does not behave in the same way as individual\n_PutItem_ and _DeleteItem_ calls would. For example, you cannot specify\nconditions on individual put and delete requests, and _BatchWriteItem_ does\nnot return deleted items in the response.\nIf you use a programming language that supports concurrency, you can use\nthreads to write items in parallel. Your application must include the\nnecessary logic to manage the threads. With languages that don't support\nthreading, you must update or delete the specified items one at a time. In\nboth situations, _BatchWriteItem_ provides an alternative where the API\nperforms the specified put and delete operations in parallel, giving you the\npower of the thread pool approach without having to introduce complexity into\nyour application.\nParallel processing reduces latency, but each specified put and delete request\nconsumes the same number of write capacity units whether it is processed in\nparallel or not. Delete operations on nonexistent items consume one write\ncapacity unit.\nIf one or more of the following is true, DynamoDB rejects the entire batch\nwrite operation:\n  * One or more tables specified in the _BatchWriteItem_ request does not exist.\n  * Primary key attributes specified on an item in the request do not match those in the corresponding table's primary key schema.\n  * You try to perform multiple operations on the same item in the same _BatchWriteItem_ request.

For more information, see [Queue and Message Identifiers](http://docs\n.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/ImportantIdenti\nfiers.html) in the _Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.\nYou can provide the `VisibilityTimeout` parameter in your request, which will\nbe applied to the messages that Amazon SQS returns in the response. If you do\nnot include the parameter, the overall visibility timeout for the queue is\nused for the returned messages. For more information, see [Visibility Timeout]\n(http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/Abo\nutVT.html) in the _Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.\nGoing forward, new attributes might be added. If you are writing code that\ncalls this action, we recommend that you structure your code so that it can\nhandle new attributes gracefully.",124,{"inputs":[{"name":"sqsclient"},{"name":"receivemessagerequest"}],"output":{"name":"result"}}],[11,"delete_message","","Deletes the specified message from the specified queue. You specify the\nmessage by using the message's `receipt handle` and not the `message ID` you\nreceived when you sent the message. Even if the message is locked by another\nreader due to the visibility timeout setting, it is still deleted from the\nqueue. If you leave a message in the queue for longer than the queue's\nconfigured retention period, Amazon SQS automatically deletes it.\nThe receipt handle is associated with a specific instance of receiving the\nmessage. If you receive a message more than once, the receipt handle you get\neach time you receive the message is different. When you request\n`DeleteMessage`, if you don't provide the most recently received receipt\nhandle for the message, the request will still succeed, but the message might\nnot be deleted.\nIt is possible you will receive a message even after you have deleted it. This\nmight happen on rare occasions if one of the servers storing a copy of the\nmessage is unavailable when you request to delete the message. The copy\nremains on the server and might be returned to you again on a subsequent\nreceive request.
